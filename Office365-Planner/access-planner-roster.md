# Gain access to Rosters in Microsoft Planner


Rosters are a new type of container for Microsoft Planner plans. Access to Roster-contained plans is controlled by the members on the Roster.

In General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) scenarios where the tenant admin is working on a data subject delete request, they may require access to Roster contained plans. The following PowerShell cmdlets have been built to support that access. The tenant admin can use these commands to add and remove a member. This process can be done to give themselves or another person access to a specific roster and the plan data within.

## Prerequisites for making Planner changes in Windows PowerShell

Follow the steps in [Prerequisites for making Planner changes in Windows PowerShell](prerequisites-for-powershell.md) to make Planner changes in Windows PowerShell.

## Manage Roster membership

 > [!Note]
 > If you use Microsoft Planner in a different M365 endpoint, then additionally include `-HostName <hostname Of Microsoft Planner website>` on the following commands. The default is `tasks.office.com`.

1. Run the following command to add a user to a Roster’s membership. The value returned is the added user’s AAD ID.

     ```PowerShell
     Add-PlannerRosterMember -RosterId <Roster Id> -UserAadIdOrPrincipalName "<User’s AAD ID or UPN>"
     ```

2. Run the following command to remove a user from the Roster’s membership. No value is returned, but when this command completes the user will have been removed.  

     ```PowerShell
     Remove-PlannerRosterMember -RosterId <Roster Id> -UserAadIdOrPrincipalName "<User’s AAD ID or UPN>"
     ```
