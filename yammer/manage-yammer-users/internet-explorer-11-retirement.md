# Yammer update on Internet Explorer 11 changes coming in August 2021

Yammer, along with other Microsoft 365 apps and services, will be retiring support for Internet Explorer 11 in August 2021. With the advances in web technology over the years, Internet Explorer 11 no longer provides the best experience to our customers.

We recommend transitioning to the new Microsoft Edge to take advantage of all that Yammer and Microsoft 365 apps and services has to offer. Internet Explorer 11 will continue to be supported by Microsoft as part of the OS lifecycle policy, and you can continue to access your legacy websites through Internet Explorer 11. However, the new IE Mode in the new Microsoft Edge enables users to access legacy websites within the modern browser.

## What to expect from Yammer?

Leading up to August 2021, we will provide multiple in-product messages to help users transition over to a new modern browser. In August 2021, users will no longer be able to access Yammer and all its integrations from Internet Explorer 11.

For customers using the embedded Yammer experience (Yammer Embed) on custom-built sites, we are working on updating Embed with the new Yammer experience, but this will only be available from Internet Explorer leading up to August 2021. To get the new Yammer Embed experience in August 2021, you will need to access the site from Edge or another modern browser. 

We recommend moving your site to a modern browser like Edge or configuring your site to be supported in IE mode in Edge. This will allow your users to still access all your site has to offer from a new modern browser. For more information about how to configure IE mode for your site, see [Configure IE mode policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-policies). 

## How to prepare?

We recommend that you communicate with your users about this change. If you have not already deployed Edge or allow users to access other modern browsers, we recommend that you do so. For technical documentation, see [Plan your deployment of Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/deploy-edge-plan-deployment).

If you’re looking for help on how to plan, deploy, or adopt Microsoft Edge, Microsoft offers the [FastTrack program](https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered) for customers with 150 or more paid seats of Windows 10 Enterprise. To get started, submit a [Request for Assistance with FastTrack](https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered).
