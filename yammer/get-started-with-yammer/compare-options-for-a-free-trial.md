# Compare options for a free trial of Yammer

There are two ways to try Yammer: Yammer Basic, and Yammer Enterprise. Both are easy to convert to a paid Office 365 subscription. 
  
## Differences between Yammer Basic and Yammer Enterprise

Use the following table to determine which will be most useful for you.
  
|**Category**|**Yammer Basic**|**Yammer Enterprise**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**What is it** <br/> |Yammer Basic is available for free to any user with a valid email address from their organization. It is designed for use as a quick trial to understand basic Yammer features.  <br/> This trial is not connected to Office 365.  <br/> |Yammer Enterprise includes all the enterprise management features required for security, compliance, and integration with Office 365. It is part of Office 365, so a trial of Yammer Enterprise is available as part of a trial of any Office 365 plan that includes Yammer.  <br/> When an Office 365 tenant is created, a new Yammer network is automatically created under the \*.onmicrosoft.com domain in your tenant. Any user on the domain can be part of the Yammer network, whether or not they have an Office 365 license.  <br/> |
|**Data ownership differences** <br/> |Users own their own data.  <br/> |Your organization owns the data.  <br/> |
|**Administration differences** <br/> |Users manage their own profile and content. There are no network admins.  <br/> |Two levels of network admins can manage users, configure the network, monitor content, export data, bulk update users, enable and disable some features, run reports, and merge domains into one network.  <br/> For more information, see [Yammer admin help](../yammer-landing-page.md)  <br/> |
|**User management differences** <br/> | Users can add other users.  <br/>  All users manage their own profile.  <br/> | Admins control whether users must be authenticated through Office 365.  <br/><br/>  If **Enforce Office 365 identity** is selected: <br/>  <br/>  - All Yammer Enterprise users must have an Office 365 Yammer license.  <br/>- For users with Office 365 licenses, user profiles for Yammer users with Yammer licenses are synchronized from Office 365.  <br/>- Admins can control who has access to Yammer by assigning or removing licenses in the Office 365 admin center. This lets you plan and sequence your roll out of Yammer.<br/>- If Office 365 identity is not enforced, any user with an email address on the domain can be included for free. These users must update their own profiles. <br/>- Admins can block and remove users.  <br/>- Admins can choose which profile fields are visible<br/>|
|**Group differences** <br/> | Internal and external groups can be set up by any user.  <br/> | Admins can control who can set up external groups.  <br/><br/>  Office 365 connected groups provide access to a shared SharePoint document library, SharePoint site, OneNote, and Planner for the group.  <br/><br/>  Dynamic groups can be used to automatically populate groups based on your organization's directory.  <br/> |
|**Customization differences** <br/><br/> | Group admins can select a group image, color, and pattern.  <br/> | Admins can customize the header and logo and choose a logo for Yammer emails. If they enforce Office 365 identity, the Office 365 theme is used to customize the header.  <br/><br/> |
|**Integrations** <br/> | Access to apps from the Yammer App Directory. Apps that require running as a verified admin will not work.  <br/>  Limited access to the Yammer APIs.  <br/> | Full access to all apps from the Yammer App Directory.  <br/> <br/> Integration with SharePoint, Microsoft Dynamics, and other solutions.  <br/><br/>  Full access to all Yammer APIs.  <br/> <br/> For more information, see [Integrate Yammer with other applications](../integrate-yammer-with-other-apps/integrate-with-other-applications.md).  <br/> |
|**Compliance features** <br/> |Users can export their own data and delete their own data and their own account.  <br/> <br/>For more information, see [Manage GDPR data subject requests in Yammer Basic](../manage-security-and-compliance/gdpr-requests-in-yammer-basic.md) <br/> |Admins can create a network usage policy, export data, monitor keywords and conversations, use Exchange Online mail flow rules, and set data retention policies. Admins can also restrict types of files that can be uploaded.  <br/><br/> Admins can export all network data, and remove users and user data from the network. For more information, see [Manage GDPR data subject requests in Yammer Enterprise](../manage-security-and-compliance/gdpr-requests-in-yammer-enterprise.md).  <br/> |
|**Domain differences** <br/> |Available on one domain. Each SMTP email suffix has its own Yammer network.  <br/> |Admins can configure and manage multiple domains in Office 365 which all use one Yammer network. <br/> <br/> Multiple Yammer networks can be merged together so when the user logs on, they enter a single Yammer network with all their colleagues, regardless of which company SMTP email address was used to log on. <br/> <br/> For more information, see [Manage Yammer domains across their lifecycle in Office 365](../configure-your-yammer-network/manage-yammer-domains.md).  <br/> |
|**Support differences** <br/> |Use the [Yammer community forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330921) and click **Questions**.  <br/> |Admins can [request support in the Office 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=869749).  <br/> Online support resources for admins include the [Customer Success Program](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524139), [Office 365 FastTrack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870053), and the [Yammer community forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330921).  <br/><br/>  For a complete list of support options, see [Welcome to Yammer Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=331325).  <br/> |

## Convert from a free trial of Yammer Basic to a paid Office 365 plan
<a name="BKMK_ConvertBasic"> </a>

1. Sign up for an Office 365 plan that includes Yammer at [Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=321496.)
    
2. In Office 365 setup, verify the same domain you used for Yammer Basic.
    
3. Decide how you will manage users in Yammer Enterprise. After converting, you may have some users that are just in Yammer and not in Office 365. For more information, see [Office 365 sign-in for Yammer](../manage-yammer-users/office-365-sign-in.md).
    
## Convert from a free trial of Office 365 with Yammer Enterprise to a paid Office 365 plan
<a name="BKMK_ConvertEntTrial"> </a>

Keep in mind that a domain can be verified on only one tenant at a time. To preserve your Yammer Enterprise network and all your trial Office 365 configuration post-trial, purchase your plan from your trial account. 
  
If you decide to move your domain to a new tenant, a new Yammer network will be created under that tenant. You can migrate your trial tenant's Yammer network to your new tenant, but this just preserves users, not data. For more information, see [Manage Yammer domains across their lifecycle in Office 365](../configure-your-yammer-network/manage-yammer-domains.md).

## FAQs
<a name="FAQs"> </a>

### Q: My organization already has users in Office 365, do they receive automatic access to Yammer Enterprise?

**A:** Users in Office 365 plans that include Yammer automatically get a license to use Yammer Enterprise, but they are not added to your Yammer network until they log in to Yammer for the first time. The simplest way to ensure that your Office 365 users are on Yammer is by using the Yammer admin center to add them. For more information, see [Add, block, or remove Yammer users](../manage-yammer-users/add-block-or-remove-users.md). 
  
### Q. Can I have a Yammer network where some users have Office 365 licenses and some users don't?

**A:** It depends on whether you configure your Yammer network to enforce Office 365 identity. 
  
- If you select the option to enforce Office 365 identity, all users must have a Yammer license through Office 365. For more information, see [Enforce Office 365 identity for Yammer users](../configure-your-yammer-network/enforce-office-365-identity.md).
    
- If you do not choose to enforce Office 365 identity, users who are on the same email domain as your Yammer network but do not have Office 365 licenses can join the network by creating a Yammer account at http://www.yammer.com.
    
    There are some differences in how you manage users who are not using Office 365: their profiles won't be automatically filled in, and you can't block them by removing their Yammer license. These users can be made admins, create groups, and use all Yammer Enterprise features. If they are made admins, they have to get to the Yammer admin center by clicking the **Settings** icon in Yammer, and selecting **Network Admin**, rather than from the Office 365 admin center.
    
### Q: What are the limitations of Yammer (number of users, networks, documents, storage, access, and so on)?

**A:** Yammer is designed as a SaaS, multi-tenant environment with scale in mind. The  *only*  limit is file size. An individual file cannot be larger than 5 GB in Yammer Enterprise or 100 MB in Yammer Basic.) Both versions support unlimited users, unlimited files, unlimited external networks, and unlimited document types. 
  
### Q: What file types can be uploaded to Yammer?

**A:** By default, there are no restrictions on the file types that can be uploaded. A Yammer Enterprise network admin can restrict files to video and images only. We make our best effort to enforce this restriction by checking the file extension and metadata, but do not guarantee that users cannot bypass this restriction. For more information, see [Configure your Yammer network](../configure-your-yammer-network/configure-yammer.md).
  
### Q: Why am I seeing different features, colors, or a different layout than my colleagues?

**A:** As part of Yammer development methodology, we A/B test all aspects of Yammer and use data to select the better design. The tests are performed on a subset of users across all networks, so changes don't occur at the network level until they're tested and launched. For more information about our A/B testing, see [Yammer: Building for Everyone](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869622).
  
### Q: What's the roadmap for Yammer?

**A:** Yammer and Office 365 use a rapid release and iterative development methodology, so change is constant. The items currently being developed and their stage of development and testing are available here: [Office 365 Roadmap](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509914).
