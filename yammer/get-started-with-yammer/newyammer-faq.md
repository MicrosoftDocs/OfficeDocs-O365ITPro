# New Yammer FAQ

Yammer has been completely redesigned, with dozens of new capabilities that power leadership engagement, company-wide communication, and communities. New Yammer delivers a beautiful, intelligent experience across devices and deep integration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. As part of Microsoft 365, people can connect and share knowledge across the organization with open conversations backed by enterprise-grade privacy, security, and compliance.

As Microsoft’s first app built from the ground up with the Fluent Design System, new Yammer provides an engaging and easy-to-use experience on the web and in the Yammer apps for Android and iOS. In addition, Yammer can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, as a Communities app in the left rail and on mobile devices, enabling you to access organization-wide communities without leaving the hub for teamwork. Integration with Outlook lets you read, like, and reply to Yammer conversations from within your Outlook inbox. Yammer also provides an updated integration experience in SharePoint Online with the  Conversations web part.
 
Building on a decade of customer success and feedback, new Yammer delivers many top customer requests. A new, personalized conversation feed powered by AI connects you with conversations across the organization. Each community can be given a unique identity with branding and cover photos. Communicators can highlight conversations with pinned posts and close discussions to prevent replies. Leaders can broadcast live and on-demand events with a new, simpler production option using webcams and desktop sharing, and attendees can watch in Yammer, on mobile, or in the new Teams integrations.

## What’s new and different about this experience?

The new Yammer experience is built fully in Fluent, the Microsoft design language, strengthening coherence between Yammer and other Microsoft 365 apps. Along with the UI, we've added new capabilities, such as:

- New reactions – including Love, Laugh, Celebrate, Thank, and Sad – provide a wider range of ways to interact with colleagues on conversations.
- Yammer admins, verified admins, and global admins can bring extra attention to a conversation by featuring it for the network.  
- To better convey the purpose of Yammer, groups are now called communities.
- Pin your favorite communities to the sidebar to make them easier to find.
- Brand your network with your company logo on the home page.
- Make your communities shine with vibrant cover photos.
- Customize All Company, just like any other community, by adding a cover photo and avatar.
- Restrict posting in All Company to make it an official corporate communications channel.
- Work with Yammer from Teams with the Teams Communities app.
- Pin important posts at the top of your communities to ensure members see them.
- Close conversations that have concluded.
- Enable users to report a conversation to better moderate your network.
- Enhanced home feed helps users discover top posts from communities, people, and topics they follow.
- New publisher experience provides the ability to include any type of content in an announcement and to announce any type of post.
- With new bolder conversation styling, posts, questions, and praise stand out for even greater engagement.
- Rich media uploading and viewing improvements, including recently used file suggestions, enhance engagement.
- Live Events provide a dedicated event page with questions as the default post type.
- Live events are promoted at the top of the discovery feed.
- Users can create and annotate a short video on a mobile device.
- New people card experiences are aligned with Microsoft 365, presenting a consistent profile experience across all apps.
- New Yammer is great in mobile browsers, delivering a responsive experience that works on the go.
- Provide feedback from the suite header without leaving Yammer.
- Easily switch to external networks from the suite header.
- Admins can mute a community that’s less relevant or controversial for the network, and end-users can mute a community in their feeds.

...and much more!

## How do I enable new Yammer within my organization?  

Yammer global administrators and verified network admins can configure access to new Yammer through the Yammer admin portal. From there, they can enable the toggle to display in the suite header or enable new Yammer across their network. For more information about managing opt-in settings, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

## Do you have materials available to help in rolling out the new Yammer within my organization?

Yes! The [Yammer Adoption Center](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/yammer/adoption/) includes materials to help you deploy new Yammer across your organization. This includes email templates for your internal announcement, Yammer tips and tricks, and a template for the new Community cover photos. There’s also a [Yammer end user guide](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8D13E85F1CF91770!254&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!ACrN15bnGCy_ZTs) to help your organization get up-to-speed quickly. 


## Who is eligible to access the new experience?

People in your organization who sign into Yammer with Microsoft 365 will be able to view the toggle to opt in to the new experience. This will be available for canonical (home) networks only. Microsoft 365 users who participate in external networks will participate using the classic Yammer experience. Users will always be able to access a direct link to the new experience.

## Will I know when additional changes are coming?

We will update this document as we launch new features and post on the Admin Message Center whenever we have any major announcements.

## How do I open a support case?

Please see the [Support for business products - Admin Help page](/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products) for general information. Your organization may have specific guidance for opening support cases, so you may need to talk with your IT team.

## How should I submit feature requests and feedback?

Feature requests and feedback on the product should be submitted through the in-product feedback dialog boxes. Feedback can also be provided with peers through the [new Yammer Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer/ct-p/Yammer).

## What steps should I take before reporting a technical problem?

Before reporting a technical problem to Microsoft Support, please check the following:

- **Can the issue be reproduced consistently?** If the issue is not occurring now, then it may have been resolved by a recent product update.
- **Does the issue only occur for the new Yammer?** Or, does it also occur with the classic user experience too?
- **Can the issue be reproduced in multiple browsers?** Testing with at least two different web browsers is a best practice. 
- **Does the issue show up on mobile as well?** Sometimes issues occur with a backend service and can affect multiple clients (web, mobile, or desktop.)
- **Are multiple users affected?** Issues affecting multiple users are more likely to be prioritized.
- **Do you have clear screenshots?** Closely cropped screenshots can miss important information that is showing elsewhere on the screen.
- **Is there any relevant information in the browser developer tools?** Support may ask you to check the JavaScript console for error information. While not everyone is familiar with JavaScript, you can often press F12 in your browser on Windows and look for red error messages in the console tab.

## FAQ

**Q: Can we opt out of new Yammer at any time?**
A: Any users who have opted into the new Yammer experience will remain in that experience until they choose to go back to the classic experience. For more information about managing the available options, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

**Q: Will links automatically redirect to the new or classic Yammer depending on my user setting?**

A: Yes.

**Q: Is the new experience available for customers that have a Yammer network with EU data residency?**

A: Yes!  
 
**Q: What about guest users in external groups?**

A: Users will either see the new Yammer or the classic Yammer experience depending on the state of their home network. If your network hosts an external group, people within your network that are opted-in will see that group in the new Yammer experience. Any guest users within the external group will see the classic Yammer experience if their network is not yet enabled for the new experience. 

**Q: What about external networks?**

A: Users can continue to access external networks through the Network Switcher icon available on the integrated tool bar at the top of every page. On switching, users will see these external networks in the classic experience.
 
**Q: Is the new Yammer fully accessible?**

A: Yes, our new Yammer web experience meets the industry’s accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0) which means that our core scenarios meet accessibility requirements. However, there are non-core scenarios where users may run into accessibility issues but these scenarios won’t hinder the full Yammer experience.

**Q: Are all languages supported in new Yammer?**

A: All languages available in classic Yammer are available in new Yammer.
