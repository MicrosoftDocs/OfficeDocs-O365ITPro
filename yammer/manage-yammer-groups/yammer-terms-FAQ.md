# Yammer Live Events convergence preview Terms & Conditions and FAQ
Yammer Live Events create connection and engagement between leaders and employees, bringing live video and interactive discussions to a whole new level.

As a part of bringing new Teams experiences into Yammer, we’re delighted to announce the public preview of broadcasting Yammer Live Events using the Teams player instead of Microsoft Stream. 

The Videos on Demand (VOD) will be stored in the SharePoint site of the Yammer community and allow for full functionality (post-event AI transcripts, editing transcripts, and full support of M365 information protection policies).

This preview and associated feedback are governed by the Preview terms in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/product-licensing/products). Features will change during the preview and certain capabilities might not be at parity with the existing Yammer experience. 

  > [!NOTE]
> Only a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator can authorize participation in the preview.

**Preview FAQ**

**1.	What is the Yammer Live Events Convergence Preview?**

This preview enables event organizers to produce and broadcast their Yammer Live Events in their community using the new Teams player. Attendees will watch the newly produced Live Events videos in their Yammer community on the Teams player instead of Microsoft Stream.

**2.	What are the new options for producing Yammer Live Events?**

Live Event producers can produce their events using the new Teams QuickStart or Teams External app or device options. These options are listed above the legacy Stream options to produce the event. 
 
**3.	Where are the videos stored once they are produced?**

The Video-on-Demand is stored in the SharePoint Community where the event was hosted is automatically shared with members of the private community, or with everyone across the Yammer network if the event was produced in a public community. 

**4.	Can Event Producers edit videos?**

Yes, the videos can be edited in SharePoint. The edited video in SharePoint is automatically updated for attendees to watch. Note that it could take 10 minutes before producers can edit their videos after the event is completed.  

**5.	What happens to the old live events videos that were broadcast via Microsoft Stream?**

Live Events videos created using Stream will continue to function – attendees can continue to watch those videos on demand broadcasted on Microsoft Stream. We will announce a process to migrate the Stream videos to SharePoint in the future.

**6.	What should I test and provide feedback on?**

We’d love all your feedback! Specifically, test and provide feedback on the following:

(1).   Produce an event using the new Teams QuickStart and/or External App or Device.

(2).   Watching a Live Event (Live) and on demand as an attendee on Yammer.

You can validate and provide feedback [here](https://forms.office.com/r/98mDquqnuc).

**7.	Can I preview in a test tenant?** 

Yes, have the Microsoft 365 Global Administrator for the test tenant complete the [Preview Sign up form](https://forms.office.com/r/DPF6rh00m8). Once the preview is enabled you will be informed via email.

**8.	How does the preview get enabled?**

Have your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator complete the [Preview Sign up form](https://forms.office.com/r/DPF6rh00m8). 

**9.	How do I provide feedback?**

Thank you for providing your feedback! Provide feedback through this [survey](https://forms.office.com/r/98mDquqnuc) or by emailing [YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com).

**10.	Does the Service Level Agreement apply in the Live Events Convergence preview?**

The SLA for Microsoft Online Services doesn't apply to this preview.
 
**11.	Can I open a Support case to investigate an issue with the Live Events Convergence preview?**

No, we’re not offering break/fix support through Microsoft’s Support Channels during this preview. Don't open Support Cases for issues related to the Live Events Convergence experience during the preview timeframe. Live Events Convergence is unsupported. During the preview, if any issues arise, we request that you report the issue on this conversation or email [YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com). Note that any existing support for Yammer Live Events (based on Stream) isn't impacted by this preview.

Yes, you can opt out of the preview after electing to be a part of the preview. Have your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator email [YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com) to ask your tenant to be removed from the preview.

**13.	When is Live Events Convergence becoming Generally Available?** 

Roll out for General Availability (GA) is planned for Q4 2022. Note that this date is subject to change. Once GA, the feature will be turned on for all Yammer networks – you don’t need to do anything to turn on the feature. 

**14.	Are there any limitations in the preview?**

(a).   As this is a new feature on Yammer that depends on Teams, your tenant must also be set up for the Teams Public Preview. Sign up [here for the Teams Public Preview](/MicrosoftTeams/public-preview-doc-updates.md).

(b).   If you don’t see the Live Event video in the SharePoint Community where the event was produced, and it’s been 24 hours after your event has completed, email [YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YamConvergence@service.microsoft.com).
