# Customize the look of your Yammer network

To make your Yammer network your own, change the colors and images used in various headers.

## Customize the Yammer header for people who sign-in to Yammer not using their Office 365 identity
<a name="YammerHeader"> </a>

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization is using Microsoft or Office 365, the network colors and network logo settings only apply to network guests. Microsoft and Office 365 users will not see these changes.

1. In the Yammer admin center, click **Design**.
    
    Under **Select Network Colors**, pick a background color, or enter color hex codes for the **Header Background Color** and the **Header Text Color (Desktop App only)**. 

    Note that choosing a custom color for your header text applies only to the desktop application. On the web, text color is automatically selected (either black or white) based on the color of the header background. 
    
2. In the **Customize Network Header and Logo** section, select the files to use. Select a 40 pixels x 160 pixels file to use for the network logo, and a 56 pixels x 1200 pixels file to use as the background image in the header. 
    
## Set the logo for email notifications Yammer sends users
<a name="NotificationLogo"> </a>

1. In the Yammer admin center, click **Design**.
    
2. Under **Select Logo for Yammer Emails**, select a file that is 50 pixels x 1160 pixels.
    
## FAQ

**Q: Why don't I see changes made to network colors or logo?**

A: These settings in the Yammer admin center only apply to users who are not signed in to Microsoft 365 or Office 365. If your organization is using Microsoft 365 or Office 365, only network guests see these changes. 

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users see the Microsoft theme for the organization. To customize this theme, see [Customize the Microsoft 365 theme for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/8275da91-7a48-4591-94ab-3123a3f79530).
