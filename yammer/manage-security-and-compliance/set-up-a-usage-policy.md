# Set up a Yammer usage policy

Creating a usage policy and requiring users to accept it can help make sure conversations on Yammer Enterprise are positive, constructive, and in line with your company policies and culture. 
  
You can choose to have the usage policy appear as a link in the side bar in each user's Yammer home screen and to display the policy as a pop-up that users must accept before entering the network. 
  
![The usage policy is displayed on the right sidebar](../media/f80d122b-f7dd-4b14-9981-7d3deb04646e.png)
  
## Set up or modify a Yammer usage policy

1. To create or modify your usage policy and usage policy settings, in the Yammer admin center, click **Usage Policy**. 
    
2. Select when users should see the policy, and whether to display the reminder in the sidebar.
    
3. Enter your usage policy title, and sidebar message. 
    
4. Enter your usage policy text. You can use HTML code to format your usage policy. Basic HTML tags including links and basic formatting are allowed within the usage policy. (JavaScript is not allowed.) 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Use the [Sample Yammer usage policy](set-up-a-usage-policy.md#SampleUsePolicy) for ideas of what to include. 
  
## Tips for creating your usage policy

For best results, we recommend that your usage policy:
  
- Is primarily positive and explanatory (and not just a list of "don'ts").
    
- Encourages usage by providing positive examples and suggestions.
    
- Requires that content be office‐appropriate.
    
- Includes a link for reporting inappropriate content.
    
You can include HTML links to relevant company policy information and to Yammer training resources.

## Set up a Yammer browser policy

You can add a custom link to your organization's browser policy. The link will be included in the banner that is automatically displayed for some obsolete browsers. Your organization's browser policy might include information such as restrictions on which current browser to use and where to get a current browser.
  
 For example, if the admin specifies the URL for the browser policy as http&#58;//www&#46;contoso&#46;com/IT/browserpolicy&#46;htm, this is what the user will see at the top of the page when they use an old browser: 
  
![Example of custom browser policy URL in obsolete browser notification](../media/54b99150-36a7-496e-bb27-2bd03786517c.png)
  
 **Add a link to your organization's browser policy**
  
1. In the Yammer admin center, click **Usage Policy**, and then click **Set a custom browser policy URL within your company**. 
    
2. Specify the URL where your organization's browser policy is defined.
