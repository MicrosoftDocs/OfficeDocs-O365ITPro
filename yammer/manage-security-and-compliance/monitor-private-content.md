# Monitor private content in Yammer

Private content in Yammer should be just that—private. However, sometimes there is a need for a verified admin to look into private messages or other content. For example, say you get a report that someone is harassing someone else on a private thread. You need to be able to make sure that members of the network are behaving according to your company's standards. 
  
As the verified admin of a Yammer network, you can temporarily grant yourself access to private content to investigate issues, and you can then turn off access again to go back to default mode, where you can't read private content. Granting access to private content applies to the following types of content in Yammer:
  
- Private messages
    
- Private groups
    
- Messages, files, and notes in Private groups
    
- Profiles
    
> [!NOTE]
> If your Yammer network is associated with Office 365, anyone who is a global admin in Office 365 is also a verified admin in Yammer. 
  
 **Grant a verified admin access to private content on Yammer**
  
1. Log on to Yammer as a verified admin.
    
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Network Admin**.
    
3. Under **Content and Security**, select **Content Mode**.
    
4. Select **Private Content Mode**, and choose **Save**.
    
    When this mode is selected, you can see private conversations or content in private groups. A banner will show you that you are viewing private content. Private content is visible only to you, the verified admin who turned on Private Content Mode, not to all verified admins in the network.
    
When you are done investigating an issue, go back and set the network back to the default mode, where private content is not visible to verified admins.
  
 **Make private content private again, even to a verified admin**
  
1. Log on to Yammer as a verified admin.
    
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Network Admin**.
    
3. Under **Content and Security**, select **Content Mode**.
    
4. Select **Default Mode (Recommended)**, and choose **Save**.
