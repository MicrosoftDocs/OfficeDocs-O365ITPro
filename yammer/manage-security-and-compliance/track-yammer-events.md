# Track Yammer events in the Office 365 audit log and with the Management Activity API

To monitor security and compliance related Yammer events for your organization, turn on audit logging and view changes to users, groups, files, admins and network settings. The audit logs are available in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance center or by using the Office 365 Management Activity API. 
  
You must have the Office 365 global admin role or the Audit Logs role in Exchange online to audit events. You can view Yammer events from your home network, but not from external networks. The events you can search include the following categories:
  
- **Users** — including activating, suspending, and deleting a user. 
    
- **Groups** — including creating and deleting of Microsoft 365 connected Yammer groups. This API does not provide data for legacy Yammer groups.
    
- **Files** — including creating, viewing, and deleting a file. 
    
- **Admins** — including exporting data, triggering private content mode and forcing all users to log out. 
    
- **Network settings** — including changing interval for exporting data and changing data retention policy.
