# SharePoint enterprise social experience - Yammer and Newsfeed

Office 365 includes two options for enterprise social features in SharePoint: Yammer and Newsfeed. The SharePoint administrator selects which option users see when they click **Conversations** in SharePoint. By default, users see Newsfeed. 
  
You can turn Yammer off or on for conversations in SharePoint by using the SharePoint Online admin center. **You must be a global administrator to make this change.**

## What happens for the following features when Newsfeed is on or off?
<a name="TurnonNewsfeed"> </a>

When Newsfeed is turned off, Yammer is the social experience where you can follow people and the information they share. To reduce confusion, the ability to follow people, documents, and tags in SharePoint Newsfeed is turned off. If you turn Newsfeed on, you get the ability to follow people, documents, and tags in SharePoint Newsfeed. Note that even if Newsfeed is off, basic operations continue to work. For example, you can still follow sites for bookmarking purposes and the [Video: Follow a SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/33db6fa5-9528-45d7-bcc7-f9c1faaacae0) is still available.

### A: Wait, will I lose following data if the Newsfeed is turned off?
