# Get work done with Kaizala Actions

Kaizala offers a wide range of action cards or mini apps that make your daily work management easy and efficient. You can use the out-of-the-box Action cards or create your own customized Kaizala Actions. Let’s get you started with some of the Kaizala Actions such as survey, attendance, and job that can help you get work done.

5. You can use the Survey Action card for several scenarios where data from remote workers needs to be collected. Some examples are collecting sales data from agents, conducting remote audits, and checking on faraway operations. 
6. Detailed reporting on all surveys sent out to your employees, suppliers, and partners can be viewed on the Kaizala management portal under **Analytics** > **Surveys**.
