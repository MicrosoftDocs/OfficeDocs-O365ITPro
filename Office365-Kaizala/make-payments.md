# Make payments through the Kaizala app

Using the Kaizala mobile app, you can now quickly send or receive money. With the Bharat Interface for Money Unified Payment Interface (BHIM UPI), you no longer need the recipient's account information or IFS code. BHIM UPI allows you to make direct bank-to-bank money transactions, simply by using a mobile number or a BHIM UPI ID (also known as Virtual Payment Address or VPA). Your BHIM UPI ID is your unique identifier on the BHIM UPI system. For example, your BHIM UPI ID on Kaizala will look like this: yourusername@contosobank. You can then share your BHIM UPI ID with anyone, and they can quickly transfer money to you. With a BHIM UPI ID, you don't need to share your phone number, bank account number, or IFS code. You can also share your BHIM UPI ID with any merchant sites you shop on, and they will send a "make payment" request to you.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only send and receive money from other people in India.

## Troubleshooting payment issues

Read this section to help troubleshoot issues that you're having in Kaizala payments.
  
### Limits on a transaction

The BHIM UPI system and banks place limits on the number of transactions you can make, and the total amount that you can transfer, on a daily or monthly basis. You may reach a limit if:
  
- You have sent ₹1,00,000 in the last 24 hours across all BHIM UPI apps using the same bank account.
    
- You've made more than 20 transactions across all BHIM UPI apps in the last 24 hours using the same bank account.
    
Your bank may have limits on how much you can send or receive using BHIM UPI. Contact your bank for more information.
  
### Can't verify your phone number

If you're having trouble completing the SMS text verification for your account, try the following:
  
- Make sure you're using a SIM which is associated with the same phone number as you are using for Kaizala.
    
- Make sure you're able to send SMS text messages from your phone.
    
- Make sure you are using the phone's default messaging app for SMS.
    
- Make sure you have internet access on your phone.
    
If these steps don't work, contact kaizala﻿payments@microsoft.com with your issue.
  
### Unable to send or receive money

If you're unable to send or receive money, check the following:
  
- Make sure that you have a working internet connection.
    
- Make sure that you're using the correct BHIM UPI PIN. If you've forgotten your BHIM UPI PIN, then change or reset it.
    
- Make sure you haven't reached the limit on your transactions.
    
### Issues with a transaction

Check the following if you're having trouble sending money:
  
- You entered the wrong BHIM UPI PIN.
    
- You don't have enough money in your bank account.
    
- You entered the wrong bank account details for the recipient.
    
- You've reached a transaction limit.
    
- The recipient can't receive money because they've reached their transaction limit.
    
- Your bank is having technical issues.
    
- If the transaction status is **Failed**, and your account was debited, but the recipient didn't receive the funds; the money will be refunded to you. It may take up to 5 days for the refund process to complete. 
    
- If the transaction status is **Pending**, and your account has been debited, but the recipient hasn't received the money; you may need to wait for the bank to complete the transaction. Ask the recipient to check their online banking statement to see if they have received the money. Check the real-time status of the transaction by tapping the refresh icon on the top right of the transaction details page. Wait for the status to get updated to avoid making the payment twice.
