# Kaizala Web

Kaizala Web lets you access Kaizala through a browser on your computer. It gives you many of the same features as the Kaizala app. Before you can use Kaizala Web, you need to log in to the Kaizala app on your mobile device.
  
For more info about Kaizala, see [Microsoft Kaizala](https://products.office.com/en/business/microsoft-kaizala).
  
## Set up Kaizala Web

1. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Kaizala on your mobile phone. If you see the **Kaizala Web** tab under **Chats** \> **More** ![Screenshot of More icon](media/more-icon.png) in the Kaizala app, then you have access to the web app.
    
2. Download the latest app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.
    
3. Go to https://webapp.kaiza.la/ in your Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome web browser.
    
4. Enter your Kaizala phone number, and then select **Generate Code**.

5. From the Kaizala app on your mobile phone, go to **Chats** \> **More** ![Screenshot of More icon](media/more-icon.png) \> **Kaizala Web** to view the pairing code.
  
6. From the **Verify Code** page on your browser, enter the pairing code, and then select **Verify &amp; Sign in**.
