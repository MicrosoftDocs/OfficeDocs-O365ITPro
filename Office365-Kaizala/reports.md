# Kaizala reports

The **Kaizala Reports** dashboard allows global and group admins to view reports and telemetry data for Kaizala actions, within organization groups. Reporting isn't available for private conversations and groups.
  
Data for all reports is displayed within 4 to 5 minutes. You can experience delays of up to 4 hours for reflecting reports, after a group is first marked as an organizational group.
