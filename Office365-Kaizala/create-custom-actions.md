# Create your own Kaizala Actions

You can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface within the Kaizala management portal. This can be done by building on the out-of-the-box Survey Action.

Here’s how to quickly get your workforce ready to create custom Kaizala Actions.

## Step 1 – Create a Kaizala Action

To create a new Kaizala Action:

1. Navigate to **Actions** from the left navigation bar.
2. Select **New Action** from the top right of the page.
3. Select one of the available templates:
   - **New Form** – Use this template to collect data in a form from your group members. Your members can fill out the form at any time.
   - **New Survey** – Use this template to request data from group members. Just create a Survey Action with pre-filled questions. You can send the Action via the app at regular intervals.
   - **Feedback** – Use this template to collect any type of feedback from a group.
   - **Announcement** – Use this template to make key announcements and share updates to a group.
4. Fill out the information on the page, and then click or tap **Next**.
5. For a selected template, enter the relevant details described in the following section.

|Menu     |What it's for  |
|---------|---------|
|Action name        |This is the name of the survey or poll that users see in their Kaizala mobile app.  |
|Brief description  |This is shown to a user in the discover tab of the Kaizala app.  |
|Customize icon     |Choose the icon for your Kaizala Action.   |

### Survey and form actions

1. Enter a card title. This is shown on the card-view of the Action, after the action has been posted.
2. Enter the question details and choose your answer types. You can add more questions by selecting **Add More Questions**. You can even choose to add questions on a new page.
3. After you have entered the question details, click or tap **Next**.
4. On the next page, tap check boxes if you would want the respondents to find:
   - Action introduction page (where users would find details about the Action)
   - Summary page (where users can review their submissions before submitting their responses)
   - Request for user's location as part of the response.
5. You can further customize the Response View, Immersive View, and Chat view.
6. After you are done, click or tap **Submit**. Users will now be able to see the detail page of the new action. At this moment, the action is in draft state.
7. Finally, publish the action. Learn about [the publishing process](/kaizala/actions/publish#steps-to-publish-an-action).

## Step 2 – Add a Kaizala Action to a group

You can publish a Kaizala Action to one or more groups. When you do so, all the group members will see the Action on the **Discover** tab of the Kaizala mobile app. The Action only appears to members of the relevant group. If a group has a managed Action palette, Actions will be visible directly in the group's Action palette.

To add a Kaizala Action to a group:

1. Select the group from the **Groups** page.
2. Navigate to the **Action** tab. Click or tap **Add Action**.
3. Select the action that you want to publish. Choose the user roles for which you would like the action to be published.
4. Click or tap **Publish**.

To remove a Kaizala Action from a group:

1. Select the group to be removed from the **Groups** page.
2. Navigate to the **Action** tab. Find the action that you want to remove.
3. Click or tap **More** ![Screenshot of More icon](media/more-icon.png), and then click or tap **Remove**.
