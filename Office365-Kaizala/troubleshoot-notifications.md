## Oppo CPH1609

There are a couple of things you'll have to do to turn on the notifications on the Oppo.
  
1. Go to **Settings** \> **Advanced Settings** on your Android device. 
    
2. Tap the **Battery** option and then tap **Protected apps**.
    
3. Go to Kaizala and select the option to protect it.
    
 **You'll also need to change an option in your Android 6.0 version and later.**
  
1. Go to **Settings** and open the apps section. Then go to ** Advanced **.
    
2. Go to **Ignore Battery Optimizations**.
    
3. Go to **Kaizala** and select the option to protect it. 
    
 **For Android versions before 6.0, you'll also need to change a few settings.**
  
1. Go to **Settings** \> **Battery**.
    
2. Go to Kaizala and turn off **Freeze in background** \> **Automatically optimise when an abnormality is detected**.
    
Now allow notifications.
  
1. Go to **Settings** \> ** notification panel &amp; status bar ** \> **Notifications**.
    
2. Go to Kaizala and turn on **Notifications** and **Priority Display**.
    
Now auto-start for Kaizala.
  
1. Go to **Security Centre App** \> **Privacy Permissions**.
    
2. Go to **Startup Manager** and make sure **Startup in background** is turned on. 
    
If you've tried all the above steps and are still having issues, you can try locking Kaizala in the recent apps overview panel. This will make sure that Kaizala is always running in the background. To do this, open Kaizala, hit the square (aka 'app overview') button on the navigation bar, then pull down on Kaizala to lock it into place.
