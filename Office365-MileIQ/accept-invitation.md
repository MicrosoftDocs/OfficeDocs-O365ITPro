# Accept an invitation to join MileIQ

Organizations that have Office 365 Business Premium or other large company Office 365 subscriptions can invite their employees to use MileIQ. When you receive an email invitation to join MileIQ from your organization, you can accept or decline the invitation.

You have complete control of your drive information in MileIQ. Your organization will only see the drives you choose to report. Your mileage rate is set by your organization and you can't change it.

## Accept the join invitation

1. Select **Get started with MileIQ** in your join MileIQ email invitation.
2. Enter your **work email address**. This will be associated with your MileIQ account.
3. When prompted, enter your **work password**. Depending on your organization's requirements, you may see additional authentication screens.
4. When your work email credentials are verified, select **Join**.
5. You can download the MileIQ app on your mobile device or you can view the MileIQ web dashboard on your computer.

    - If you opened your join MileIQ email invitation on your mobile device, select **Download MileIQ** to install the MileIQ app from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/mile-tracker-mileage-log-for/id578830929?mt=8) or from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobiledatalabs.mileiq).  
    - If you opened your join MileIQ email invitation on your computer, select **Visit web dashboard** to visit your MileIQ web dashboard. You can download MileIQ on your mobile device at a later time.
    - After you download MileIQ on your mobile device and sign in to your MileIQ account with your work email address, you are ready to take your first drive with MileIQ!

> [!NOTE]
> MileIQ email invitations can't be forwarded from the intended recipient to other email addresses. If you receive a MileIQ email invitation that has been forwarded to you, please contact your organization's global admin or business administrator.

## Decline the join invitation

You can decline the join invitation by not selecting **Get started with MileIQ** in the join MileIQ email invitation. There is no time expiration on the invitation to join MileIQ as long as your global admin or business administrator has not rescinded your invitation. 

By not accepting the join MileIQ invitation, you miss out on the benefit of using MileIQ with your organization's custom mileage rate.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you received a join MileIQ invitation, but already have a MileIQ account under your work email address or a different email address, please contact our MileIQ admin center support team at [miqadmin@microsoft.com](mailto:miqadmin@microsoft.com) for assistance.
> - Your organization's global admin or business administrator can remove your MileIQ account from your organization at any time. You can still use MileIQ on your own. Reimbursement rates may reset to the standard IRS rates. Your use of other Microsoft products and services should not be affected.
