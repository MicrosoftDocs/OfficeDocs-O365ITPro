### Technical support case handling

21Vianet assigns a severity level to a case when it is opened, based on an assessment of the issue type and customer impact. Examples of issue types and severity levels are shown in the following table.

|
|

|**Severity level**|**Operations and support description**|**Examples**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Sev A (Critical)  <br/> |One or more services aren't accessible or are unusable. Production, operations, or deployment deadlines are severely affected, or there will be a severe impact on production or profitability. Multiple users or services are affected.  <br/> | Widespread problems sending or receiving mail.  <br/>  SharePoint site down.  <br/>  All users can't send instant messages, join or schedule Skype for Business Meetings, or make Skype for Business calls.  <br/> |
|Sev B (High)  <br/> |The service is usable but in an impaired fashion. The situation has moderate business impact and can be dealt with during business hours. A single user, customer, or service is partially affected.  <br/> | Send button in Outlook is garbled.  <br/>  Setting is impossible from EAC (Exchange admin center) but possible in Windows PowerShell.  <br/> |
|Sev C (Non-critical)  <br/> |The situation has minimal business impact. The issue is important but does not have a significant current service or productivity impact for the customer. A single user is experiencing partial disruption, but an acceptable workaround exists.  <br/> | How to set user password that never expires.  <br/>  User can't delete contact information in Exchange Online.  <br/> |
