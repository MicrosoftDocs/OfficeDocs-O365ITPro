# About Microsoft 365 admin center preview

The new Microsoft 365 admin center is built for IT teams as a simplified way to manage your Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services. The admin center provides a tailored experience based on the unique needs of your role or organization, improves efficiency for everyday tasks, and provides actionable insights that help you make data-driven decisions to deliver a better experience for your users.

> [!NOTE]
> Check out [What's new in preview?](whats-new-in-preview.md) for a list of the features we've released each month.
  
The Microsoft 365 admin center is the common entry point for all Microsoft 365 and Office 365 admins and can be accessed at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024339). Specialist workspaces, like Security or Device management, allow for more granular control. For more information about how the admin centers will work together, see [What about the specific types of IT roles and other workspaces like Security, Device Management, or Exchange?](#what-about-the-specific-types-of-it-roles-and-other-workspaces-like-security-device-management-or-exchange) later in this article. 
  
As new features become available in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you'll be able to opt-in to the preview and share your feedback with Microsoft so that we can continue to improve the admin experience. If you opt-in to the preview, there will be no impact to your users, and you can switch back to the classic admin center at any time.

### How do I get back to the classic admin center?
Although you can switch to Preview from any page inside the classic admin center, in the Preview admin center you can only switch back to the classic admin center from the **Home** page. Navigate back to the preview admin center's **Home** page, and then switch the **Preview on** toggle to **Off**.
 <br/> ![Screen capture: The Preview toggle from the Home page next to the Add card button.](media/2f76101d-37bb-4bcf-8cba-a143e880cf94.png)

### How do I add cards to the **Home** page?
Select the **Add card** button at the top of the admin center Home page. 
<br> ![Screen capture explaining that the Add card link is located in the upper right-side of the Home page next to Search.](media/M365PreviewSearchBox.png)

When the card library is open, drag the cards to the **Home** page. <br> ![Screen capture showing the cards that are available in the card library. This will vary depending on your licenses](media/M365PreviewCardLibrary.png)


### The password reset button used to be on the Active user card. Where did it go?
It is still on the **User management** card, it's just a little hidden. Select the drop-down menu next to the **Edit user** button. <br> ![Screen capture explaining that the **Password reset** link is under the drop-down menu.](media/M365PreviewHomeUserMgmtCard.png)


### What happened to my custom views in Active users?
They are still there, we just now call them **Filters**. It's located at the far right of the page between **Search** and **Change view**. <br> ![Screen capture showing the open Filters menu with custom filters Contoso.com, contoso.ca, HR Department, and Executives as examples.](media/M365PreviewFilterNew.png)

When you have a filter applied to your **Active users** list, where the link used to say **Filters** it now shows the name of the filter. In this example, the HR Department filter has been applied. <br> ![Scren capture showing the **HR Department** filter applied.](media/M365PreviewFilterActive.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When an app or service is enabled for a user, we'll turn that service on in an eligible assigned license.  Admins can no longer control which apps are associated with a particular user-assigned license. 

### What about the specific types of IT roles and other workspaces like Security, Device Management, or Exchange?

The Microsoft 365 admin center is the common entry point for all teams and roles managing Microsoft 365. The experience, information, and controls are tailored and customizable for each admin and role. Additionally, specialist workspaces allow for deep, granular control. These specialist workspaces include SharePoint, Teams &amp; Skype, Exchange, Security, Compliance, Device Management, and Azure Active Directory. You can find the specialist workspaces from the navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024339).
