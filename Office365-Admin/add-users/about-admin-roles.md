# About Office 365 admin roles

 
  
Office 365 comes with a set of admin roles that you can [assign](assign-admin-roles.md) to users in your organization. Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in your organization permissions to do specific tasks in the Office 365 admin center. 
  
Here are the available roles and what people assigned to them can do.
  
> [!TIP]
> For a detailed list of what tasks each of these roles can and cannot do, and how they overlap with roles in other Microsoft services, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862394).

|**Role** <br/> |**What they do in Office 365** <br/> |
|![Global admin](../media/cbdb29d5-8d68-452a-8ccd-b337e5c86cec.png) **Global administrator (Company administrator)** <br/> |Accesses all administrative features in the Office 365 suite of services in your plan, including Skype for Business. By default, the person who signs up to buy Office 365 becomes a global admin.  <br/> Global admins are the only admins who can assign other admin roles, and only global admins can manage the accounts of other global admins. You can have more than one global admin in your organization. **As a best practice**, we recommend that only a few people in your company have this role. It reduces the risk to your business.  <br/><br/> **Tip:** Make sure everyone who is a global admin in your organization has a mobile phone number and alternate email address in their contact info. Check out [Change your organization's address, technical contact email, and other information](../manage/change-address-contact-and-more.md) for more details.  <br/> |

## Need more details about what these roles can and cannot do?

For a detailed list of what tasks each of these roles can and cannot do, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862394).
  
## What about the Azure Active Directory roles?

If you have a large business, you'll want to set roles in Azure Active Directory, too. A user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud services that your organization has subscribed to, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 admin center, or in the Azure classic portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Windows PowerShell.
  
For a list and description of all the Azure Active Directory roles, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862394).

## Delegated administration

If you're working with a Microsoft partner, you can assign them admin roles. They, in turn, can assign users in your company - or their company - admin roles. You might want them to do this, for example, if they are setting up and managing Office 365 for you.
  
A partner can assign these roles:
  
- Full administration, which has privileges equivalent to a global admin.
    
- Limited administration, which has privileges equivalent to a helpdesk/password admin.
    
Before the partner can assign these roles to users, you must add the partner as a delegated admin to your Office 365 account. This process is initiated by an authorized partner. The partner sends you an email to ask you if you want to give them permission to act as a delegated admin. For instructions, see [Authorize or remove partner relationships](https://support.office.com/article/201ccb3b-6011-4bf1-a6b2-84e7cc1ee2d0.aspx).
