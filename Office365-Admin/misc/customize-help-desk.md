# Add customized help desk info to the Office 365 help pane

As an admin, you can streamline user support by adding customized contact information to the help pane. Users in need of help will be able to access your organization's custom support contact info with the help icon.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you are an admin looking for technical or billing support from Microsoft, see [Contact Office 365 for business support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).

  - **Custom title**: Enter a title that clearly indicates your intent, like "Contoso help desk" or "Need help?"
    
  - **Help desk phone**: Enter the phone number users should call to talk to a tech support agent at your organization. Be sure to include any prefixes that may be needed to complete the call.
    
  - **Help desk email**: Enter the email address for your support department.
    
  - **Help desk URL**: If your support department has an internal or public website with helpful tools and resources, enter its name and the associated URL.
    
7. Select **Save**.
    
    To see your new customized help desk card, sign out and back in again. We recommend you test the links on the card as soon as you sign back in. Your users will be able to see the card the next time they sign in.
