# Allow members to send as or send on behalf of a Group

A member of an Office 365 Group who has been granted **Send as** or **Send on behalf** permissions can now send email as the group, or on behalf of the group. This topic explains how an admin can set these permissions.
  
For example, if Megan Bowen is part of the **Training** Office 365 Group, and has **Send as** permissions on the group, if she sends an email as the Office 365 Group, it will look like the **Training** group sent the email. 
  
The **Send on Behalf** permission lets a user send email on behalf of an Office 365 Group. For example, if Alex Wilber is a part of the **Marketing** Office 365 Group, and has **Send on Behalf** permissions and sends an email as the group, the email looks like it was sent by **Donald Forster on behalf of Marketing**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can configure **Send as** or **Send on behalf** for a given user, but not both. If you configure both, it will default to **Send as**.
