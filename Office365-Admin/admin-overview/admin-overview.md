# Office 365 admin overview 

  
When you [buy an Office 365 business plan](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856886), we give you a special account that has admin permissions. This account is called an admin account.
  
With this account you can access the admin center to manage your business: add users, manage your subscription, reset passwords, and more. Try it!

If you get the message "**You don't have permission to access this page or perform this action**," you aren't an admin.

## Who has admin permissions in my business?

When looking for your admin to reset your password, delete an account, or do other tasks, here's who you should contact:
  
- **Universities and schools**: Contact your technical support team. Usually you can find a link on your university site. At smaller schools there may only be a limited number of individuals who have admin roles. 
    
- **Large businesses**: Contact your internal help desk / technical support. 
    
- **Small businesses**: Contact the business owner / co-owner. Often they give admin permissions to their IT consultant who does all the computer maintenance work for their business. 
    
By default, the person who signs up for and buys an Office 365 for business subscription gets admin permissions. That person can assign admin permissions to other people to help them manage Office 365 for their organization.
  
If you have no idea who to contact at your work or school for help, try asking the person who gave you your user account and password.
