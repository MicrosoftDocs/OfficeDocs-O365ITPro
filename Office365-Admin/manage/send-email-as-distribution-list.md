# Send email as a distribution list in Office 365

In Office 365, you can send email as a distribution list. When a person who is a member of the distribution list replies to a message sent to the distribution list, the email appears to be from the distribution list, not from the individual user. This topic shows you how to do this.
  
## Send email as a distribution list in Office 365

Before you perform these steps, make sure you've been added to an Office 365 distribution list.
  
 **Admins**: Make sure you've followed the steps in the [Add an Office 365 user or contact to a list](../email/add-user-or-contact-to-distribution-list.md) topic, and added the correct people to the distribution list.

2. Open a message that was sent to the distribution list.
