# Stay on top of Office 365 changes

With Office 365, you receive new product updates and features as they become available instead of scheduled updates that are months or years apart. As a result, you and your users will routinely experience new and improved ways to do your job rather than a costly and time-consuming company-wide upgrade. The challenge with such a model is keeping up with the changes and updates. Here are a few ways that you can stay on top of the Office 365 updates in your organization.
