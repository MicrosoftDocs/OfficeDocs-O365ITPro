# Try or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription

Microsoft 365 is a complete solution that combines Office 365 and Windows 10 with advanced security and device management. If you already have a subscription and you want to trial or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription, the best way to do it is through the admin center. The following Microsoft 365 subscriptions are available in the admin center for you to try or buy now:
  
- Microsoft 365 Business
    
- Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3
    
- Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5
    
When you add a subscription through the admin center, the new subscription will be associated with the same organization (domain namespace) as your existing subscription. This makes it easier to move users in your organization between subscriptions or assign them a user license for the additional subscription they need.

2. On the **Purchase services** page, find the Microsoft 365 plan that you want to try or buy. 
    
    You'll see the subscriptions that are available to your organization. Any subscriptions that you've already purchased are identified like this.

3. After you've found the Microsoft 365 subscription that you'd like to buy or try, mouse over or tap the subscription. You can **Start free trial**, which gives you 25 user licenses for a one-month term, or you can **Buy now**.
