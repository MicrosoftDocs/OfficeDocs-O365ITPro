# What's new in Microsoft 365 admin center preview
We're continuously adding new features to the Microsoft 365 admin center preview, fixing issues we learn about, and making changes based on your feedback. Take a look below to see what's available for you today.

Want to know how to participate in the preview? Checkout [About the Microsoft 365 admin center preview](microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).
  
## January 2019 - Happy New Year!
- Still adding in **Services & add-ins** - We've updated more of the **Settings > Services & add-ins** pages. Try Integrated Apps or Reports to see the latest. 
- **Searching for improvements?** Look no further than the **Search** box in the command bar. It's been updated to let you search for tasks. For example, try "password reset" or "add a user".  

### Featured Feedback Fix - Licenses and apps

We re-combined **Licenses and apps** in the user details pane based on your feedback. We initially separated the two features to provide space for the details of all license and all app possibilities.  We heard from you that separating licenses and apps into two panes added confusion.  We listened, and brought licenses and apps back together into one tab.  Now you can make sure that an app is turned off in all licenses assigned to a user in one pane.  Milk and cookies.  Licenses and apps.  We get it now.

Check it out: **Users > Active users > Edit** or **Add user > Licenses and Apps**. 

## December 2018
- **Services & add-ins** - In October we updated **Settings** \> **Services & add-ins** with our new design style, but all of the settings pages were still in the classic style. This month, we've started updating the actual settings to the new design. Check out **Bookings** to see the new look.
- **User management** - Manage username, alias, primary email address.
- We've added two Home cards to the library. You can read their full descriptions in the library.
    - **Intune Device enrollment**
    - **Domains**
- **Recommendations** - You might see a new recommendation pop-up in your admin center. Of course, you'll only see recommendations if we think it will benefit your organization. But don't wait until we show you the recommendation - you can add it from the card library.
    - **Protect sensitive info** - We recommend creating a data loss prevention (DLP) policy to detect when items containing sensitive info are shared with people outside your organization.

## November 2018
- The Search box is back! And we moved it slightly. It's still at the top of the Home page, but it's now on the right-side of the page near the **Add card** button. <br> ![Screen capture explaining that the search box is located in the upper right-side of the Home page.](media/M365PreviewSearchBox.png)

- We've added cards for the dashboard. Just go to the admin center and select **Add card** to see the new cards: 
    - **Office 365 Active users report** - Monitor the usage of the Office 365 services you've purchased.
    - **Office 365 software** - Install or deploy Office 365 ProPlus software and see how many licensed users have activated it.
    - **Azure Active Directory** - Gives you quick access to common Azure AD tasks like self-serve password resets, customizing sign-in, and adding apps.
- The **Export users** quick task has been added to command bar on the Active users page. ![Screen capture showing Export users on the command bar next to Refresh.](media/M365PreviewExportUsersQT.png)
- Purchase services has additional enhancements for November. And they are ALL good! To get there, go to Billing > Purchase services. <br>![Screen capture showing purchase services page with 3 new enhancements.](media/M365PreviewBillingPurchasServices.png)
    >1. At the top of the page, you can pivot between Business and Education plans. That will help you find what you're looking for.
    >2. We added a search box so you don't have to scroll endlessly to find what you're looking for. 
    >3. Finally, we logically sorted the plans you can purchase into sections that you can expand and collapse. Don't need purchase any of the **Office apps and services**? Collapse that section and focus on Microsoft 365 plans.

## October 2018

- There's a new way to buy subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Go to **Purchase services** to see the completely redesigned shopping experience that makes it easy to search, compare plans, and other great new features that helps make purchasing a subscription easier. <br/>![Purchase services plan comparison in Microsoft 365 admin center preview](media/0ad5acf1-8ffc-44bf-aac2-c21269910e65.png)

- The **Services and add-ins** page has been updated to the new look and feel, but everything else works exactly the same. Of course, you should check out the command bar to see what new things you can do, like filtering and changing the list to compact view. In the navigation pane, go to **Settings** \> **Services &amp; add-ins** to check it out. <br/>![Settings and add-ins page in Microsoft 365 admin center preview](media/af9a3ed3-bfe6-438b-b4b5-2ca4164f8e3f.png)

## September 2018

- **Home improvements** The Home page has been completely re-done and we can't wait for you to try it out and see what you think. This is your personal Home page and you won't affect the Home pages of other admins in your organization. <br/>![Screen capture: Microsoft 365 Admin Center Preview Home Page.](media/d1a497f1-30e6-4c1a-9bb2-d4d7895906da.png)
  
  - You can add, remove, and move home page cards around the Home page. Click **+ Add card** in the top right corner to see which cards are available in the card library, and then drag them anywhere on the Home page. Don't like where it landed? Click and drag it to where you want it. You don't even have to save any more. 
    
  - Take organization to the next level by grouping cards into sections. We've created two default sections for you: **Basics** and **Devices and updates.** Very soon, you'll be able to add, remove, and rename sections to design a Home page that works for you. 
    
  - Most of the cards are informative and actionable, which means that you'll be provided with just-in-time information to help you do your daily tasks faster and smarter.
    
  - The navigation pane has been re-organized and you can customize it for your quick tasks. Just select **Edit** from the bottom of the navigation pane to start customizing. <br/>![Microsoft 365 Admin Center Preview navigation pane](media/7d5568cc-9ce8-40b2-aa87-e777fcd455e3.png)
  
- **Billing** You'll probably notice some of the biggest changes to the Microsoft 365 admin center in the Billing section. You can manage subscriptions and apps you've bought from Microsoft or another vendor, including new experiences for inventory management, order history, payment methods, and invoicing. 
    
  - Subscription management has been redesigned to give you a new inventory management experience for more product types including apps, software, and add-ins. It's now called **Products &amp; services** to better reflect the support for new product types being added. You can now choose to have a card or table view of the products and services, and you can search and filter to quickly find what you're looking for. <br/>![Products and services in Microsoft 365 admin center preview](media/f1bba7dc-2034-4a53-b4ad-b7fbef3fb442.png)
  
  - It's now easier than ever to assign a product license to your users. Select your purchased product and then you can assign the product. You can also see which users have already been assigned a particular product. <br/>![Product details from Billing in Microsoft 365 admin center preview](media/82422685-e1b7-4f3f-aea8-1819df9d9311.png)
  
  - **Switch plans** is now called ** Upgrades ** and finally the subscription upgrades happen behind the scenes so you don't have to watch the upgrade complete. Lastly, there is no longer a license limitation on upgrades. 
    
    
- **User management** We've made a lot of changes to user management to help you get your work done faster. We've updated the ** Active users ** page and the user's details pane. Here's some of the more awesome changes: 
    
  - There's a new design and new layout to the **Active users** page. Don't like the way the list looks? Select **Change view** (next to **Filter**) and you can change the list from **Normal list** to **Compact list**. Compact list is especially helpful if you've got a lot of users in your organization. <br/>![Active users page in preview](media/4dd9f1c9-ef23-4194-9ff8-5206ba2930f8.png)
  
  - The command bar (where **Search** lives) is dynamic and the list of actions will change depending on the number of users you've selected: no users, one user, or multiple users. You'll also see how many users you have selected next to **Search**. <br/>![Microsoft 365 preview Active users command bar.](media/9576bd19-31a5-4e59-a8dd-0663a833def0.png)
  
  - You can perform quick tasks like resetting passwords for single or multiple users directly from the list view.
    
  - The User's details and settings are now organized by the following tabs: **Account**, **Devices**, **Licenses**, **Apps**, **Mail**, and **OneDrive**. Previously, many of these settings were located across multiple screens. <br/>![Users detail pane in the admin center preview.](media/60c6b9d3-d62f-4b8d-97db-41ff247b1bf0.png)<br/>Curious to know how the classic admin center tasks map to the preview admin center?

## You used to do it this way...now you'll do it this way

As we optimize existing features, that functionality may move to a different place in the admin center or if we've changed the name of the feature we'll include that information in this section. If the feature has been removed, we'll also let you know what the work-around or mitigation for that feature is.
  
### Home page cards

We know that you used the Home page cards as one of the main ways to navigate around the admin center, so here's a breakdown of how the preview Home page cards map to the classic Home page cards.
  
|**Classic admin center**|**Preview admin center**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Active users  <br/> |User management  <br/> |
|DirSync  <br/> |User management  <br/> |
|Office Software  <br/> |Office 365 software  <br/> |
|Train your self  <br/> |Training &amp; guides  <br/> |
|Setup guidance  <br/> |Training &amp; guides  <br/> |
|Message center  <br/> |Message center  <br/> |
|Service health  <br/> |Service health  <br/> |
|Domains  <br/> |Domains  <br/> |
|Usage report  <br/> |Office 365 usage report  <br/> |
|Azure AD  <br/> |Azure AD  <br/> |
|Windows 10 upgrade  <br/> |Windows 10  <br/> |

|Device management  <br/> |Intune device enrollment (coming soon)  <br/> |
|Device actions  <br/> |Intune device enrollment and Windows 10  <br/> |
   
The following cards aren't available in admin center preview, so here's how you can find those pages from preview.
  
|**Classic admin center**|**Preview admin center**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Support  <br/> |In the navigation pane, select **Support** or the **Need Help** button.  <br/> |
|Admin centers  <br/> |In the navigation pane, select **Show more**, and then under **Admin centers** select **All admin centers**.  <br/> |
|Security &amp; Compliance  <br/> |The **Security &amp; Compliance center** can be found in the navigation pane under the **Admin centers** but also, we have two recommendation cards for data that's coming from the Security &amp; Compliance center and you can easily navigate to the Security &amp; Compliance center by clicking the header of those cards.  <br/> |
|Suggested features  <br/> |We're replacing the **Suggested features** card with more intelligent recommendations that will be displayed based on data about your organization. For example, if your users are connecting to your company data with their mobile phones, we'll suggest enrolling devices with Intune.  <br/> |
|Business center  <br/> |You can still get to the Business center from the Office.com home page.  <br/> |
|Help users get started  <br/> |**Helping your users get started** is being integrated with setup experiences and the setup guides. For example, if you complete the OneDrive setup guide, in the last step, you can email your end users a link to the training for OneDrive.  <br/> |
